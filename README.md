# CustomerReviewPlus Description

CustomerReviewPlus is a extension of CustomerReview. The customerreviewserver.jar should be in class path of this CustomerReviewPlus project.
In CustomerReviewPlus, I created a new function "getNumberOfReviewsForGivenRatingRange" to get review's number within a given range.
In order to check a list of curse word, I created a properties file "curse_word_prop.properties" to store all curse word. Maybe we can store these word into database, but there is no database information in "CustomerReview" folder, so I just use properties file instead of database. Of course, I can use database way to implement this function if the project "CustomerReview" is complete.

In addition, I have a SpringMVC Demo web application in my own CentOS server using skills such as JSP, Tiles, JQuery, AJAX, JTable, Maven, SpringMVC, Mybatis, MySQL, log4j.
